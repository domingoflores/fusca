COUNTER STRIKE TEAMPLAY PRINCIPLES:

0. team needs to put effort on being on the same page every round
1. try to save smokes and mollys flashes for mid/end round
2. dont get singled out don't die alone
3. play smart when up numbers 'turtle play' 
4. info: use jiggles effectively to get info if needed 
5. if holding an area alone, give it up, we at least have the info they are there (stay alive)
6. organize the team from default or after the game breaks from 5v5
7. frag in stride not recklessly (stick to calculated agression via team agreements)
8. when a call comes mid-round needs to be executed spot on and calls can be added to it


Things to improve:

0. focus on what to do rather than what happened (unless noticing enemy teams pattern)
1. better game sense as a TEAM
2. better individual game sense on how to work as a unit
3. awareness, full map gamesense and immediate gamesense
4. learn smokes, flashs, nades, mollys
5. work on mid round direction
6. chasing frags without a trading setup
7. build more team agreements
8. think of executes and tactics that can get us in the same page
